COMPUTATIONS + BLOCKCHAIN:

  ?- filter out ASLPT tokens  (or use list of tokens?)


  - add liq: without selecting pair: failing - let the 2nd token to be selected ?  or use GEM
    update_add_liquidity()


  - confirm-swap: show 'price udpated' section if the 'price' changes
    add 'disabled' to btn when price is updated

  - test swap with multi-hops
  - test swap with exact output

  - check calculations for swap with the result from the swap


  - the tokens cannot be the same

  - test with tokens with different decimals



  BACKEND

  - show list of existing pairs, with amount of liquidity, movement per day/week/month, fees
    use a simple backend replicated with aergolite (?)

  - retrieve price information for AERGO - in USD, EUR, KRW
    from:
      BUSD: Binance, Coinbase, MEXC, Kucoin
      KRW: Upbit, Bithumb
        https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aergo#markets
      then take the median value
      and store in the database, or keep in memory
      it must be available for REST request
    FRONTEND
    let the user choose the base token to be displayed?
      use the current config dialog?



  /- it is choosing a route with bad price impact, after adding liquidity
      the route has pairs with bad price

  - NOT NOW: auto-router on a smart contract (?) - for speed - test

  - when adding liquidity and going to swap, it does not recognize the current pair

  - when selecting an account: does not need to reload tokens if it is from the same network/chainId
  - allow to select another account?

  - subscribe to events from the current selected token pair contract(s)
  - when a token is selected, unsubscribe, subscribe to a new pair (if some), and request pair info
    if using a multi-hop route, subscribe to each contract on the route/path
    if using many / split routes, subscribe to each contract on all the paths


  - use separate js files - with require or import
    "cat a.js b.js > concat.js && browserify concat.js -o bundle.js && rm concat.js"

ui-general.js

ui-add-liq.js
ui-remove-liq.js



  CONTRACTS

  - update on ARC1: add field for additional info?
    it can contain the swap pair address on ASLPT contracts
    use the 'contract owner'?
    field 'metadata' 'extra' 'description' 'info' -- set only at mint time

  - make aergo/waergo be the base token on new_pair (?) (on contract)




FRONTEND + UI:

  confirmation dialogs:
  - swap confirmation dialog     id="confirm-swap"
  - transaction sent dialog      id="confirm-transaction"
  - add liquidity confirmation   id="confirm-add-liquidity"
  - success & failure dialog     id="popup-message"
  - general message dialog (replace swal?)

  - user account dialog
    account info + history of txns + link to aergoscan (to check balances)
    allow to select another account?


  - move the price impact label according to the input2 size


  - token selector: when opened in a tablet (and maybe changing browser height) it
    does not fill all the height



  - show only 1 WAERGO token contract? use curated list of tokens?

  - store images/token logos on another place




//  √  if the pair is AERGO-WAERGO then just wrap/unwrap (on the swap)
//  √  and do not allow to create a pair

// if one of the tokens is AERGO, then it must use the waergo contract when:
// - making a swap
// - adding liquidity

// when creating a pair, if one is AERGO, use WAERGO as the token



TESTS:

  - test with the swap factory:
    - create pair
    - add liquidity
    - undo add first token
    - increase liquidity
    - remove liquidity
    - swap
    - routes
