COMPUTATIONS + BLOCKCHAIN:

  - filter out ASLPT tokens  (or use list of tokens?)

  - confirm-swap: show 'price udpated' section if the 'price' changes
    add 'disabled' to btn when price is updated

  - test swap with multi-hops
  - test swap with exact output

  - check calculations for swap with the result from the swap

  - remove liq: choose to receive in waergo or aergo

  /- it is choosing a route with bad price impact, after adding liquidity
      the route has pairs with bad price

  - NOT NOW: auto-router on a smart contract (?) - for speed - test

  - when adding liquidity and going to swap, it does not recognize the current pair

  - when selecting an account: does not need to reload tokens if it is from the same network/chainId
  - allow to select another account?

  - subscribe to events from the current selected token pair contract(s)
  - when a token is selected, unsubscribe, subscribe to a new pair (if some), and request pair info
    if using a multi-hop route, subscribe to each contract on the route/path
    if using many / split routes, subscribe to each contract on all the paths

  - use separate js files - with require or import
    "cat a.js b.js > concat.js && browserify concat.js -o bundle.js && rm concat.js"


  - update on ARC1: add field for additional info?
    it can contain the swap pair address on ASLPT contracts
    use the 'contract owner'?

  - make aergo/waergo be the base token on new_pair (?) (on contract)

  - the tokens cannot be the same

  - test with tokens with different decimals




FRONTEND + UI:

  confirmation dialogs:
  - swap confirmation dialog     id="confirm-swap"
  - transaction sent dialog      id="confirm-transaction"
  - add liquidity confirmation   id="confirm-add-liquidity"
  - success & failure dialog     id="popup-message"
  - general message dialog (replace swal?)

  - display the price impact (in percent) next to the output value
    use different colors for the label, depending on the impact value (yellow, orange, red)

  - account icon - remove the 'cooker', add an 'user'
  - account info + history of txns + link to aergoscan (to check balances)

  - token selector: when opened in a tablet (and maybe changing browser height) it
    does not fill all the height


  - multi-language
      the placement of token symbol in the sentence can vary, so use {1} or %1 to represent
      the place to put variables



  - show only 1 WAERGO token contract? use curated list of tokens?

  - store images/token logos on another place




//  √  if the pair is AERGO-WAERGO then just wrap/unwrap (on the swap)
//  √  and do not allow to create a pair

// if one of the tokens is AERGO, then it must use the waergo contract when:
// - making a swap
// - adding liquidity

// when creating a pair, if one is AERGO, use WAERGO as the token



TESTS:

  - test with the swap factory:
    - create pair
    - add liquidity
    - undo add first token
    - increase liquidity
    - remove liquidity
    - swap
    - routes
